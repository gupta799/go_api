# Go Microservice with RagRedis Communication

## Overview

This project is a **Go microservice** designed to learn Go programming and explore the efficient use of goroutines for building fast and scalable APIs. The microservice communicates with another microservice, **RagRedis**, which acts as a Redis-based key-value store for caching or fast data retrieval.

## Features

- Fast and scalable microservice architecture using **Go**.
- Implements **goroutines** to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
- Communicates with a **RagRedis** microservice to perform CRUD operations on data.
- RESTful API with standard HTTP methods.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Go (version 1.19 or later)
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- RagRedis microservice (running locally or in a container)
